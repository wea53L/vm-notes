What do you know? 

enumerate: 
	find all domains
	find all open / responding ports

what services / languages / servers there? 
what can you discover / bruteforce? 
	http directories
	http files(.php, .aspx)
	CMS

get shell somehow

via jollyfrogs: 
The approach I used in the labs and in the exam was as follows:

1) Revert the machine you are about to attack (not required in the exam)
2) Run single machine port scans on the machines you are attacking:

- Single host TCP scan:
nmap -Pn -sS --stats-every 3m --max-retries 1 --max-scan-delay 20 --defeat-rst-ratelimit -T4 -p1-65535 -oA /root/192_168_15_201T 192.168.15.201

- Single host UDP scan:
nmap -Pn --top-ports 1000 -sU --stats-every 3m --max-retries 1 -T3 -oA /root/192_168_15_201U 192.168.15.201

- Detailed single host TCP scan:
nmap -nvv -Pn -sSV -T1 -p$(cat 192_168_15_201T.xml | grep portid | grep protocol=\"tcp\" | cut -d'"' -f4 | paste -sd "," -) --version-intensity 9 -A -oA /root/192_168_15_201T_DETAILED 192.168.15.201

3) Analyze the port scan results. Some ports might stand out (you will learn in the labs which ports stand out and why).

4) Detailed port attacks. You will learn in the labs which work best for you. 
	- nikto and dirb for webservers
	- nmap smb-check-vulns script and enum4linux for samba and CIFS services
	- etc 

5) Kali "searchsploit" with the service/software version of each port.
6) Exploit the vulnerability you found with searchsploit to gain a limited or root shell
7) If limited shell then use the linux or windows exploit suggesters, "searchsploit kernel x.x" and search for common weaknesses in the software.
